# MotionMax-Manager

MotionMax Manager (MMX) is a powerful software to manage your 2DOF, 2DOF+Traction Loss and 6DOF motion simulator based on Dyadic System SCN5 and SCN6 actuators created by Zappadoc. The traction loss management is included with all editions. The manager supports more than 60 games, see the list below.
The MotionMax Manager SCN Edition License is available here through EKSIMRacing and from authorized dealers. A minimum contribution to EKSIMRacing foundation is requested to get your MMX 2DOF license (please read the registration information).

MotionMax Manager project has been started in 2015 and includes the full support of 6 DOF motion simulator platform (and its 2DOF+TL declination), From PRO to casual with a full 1:1 level motion driving simulator to a simple cockpit or VR rig our 6DOF (or 2DOF+TL version) of MotionMax Manager is easy and powerful and supports a maximum of games and simulations.

MotionMax Manager is definitively a PRO Racing driving simulator software even if it can be use for flight-sim. The internal vehicle physics interpreter (V.P.I.) provides an ultra-realistic motion result in all car categories (Formula 1 and other open wheel categories/Endurance/Proto/GT/Rally/Kart).

It contains an unique and exclusive “Yaw Dynamics” feature to accurately control the amount of the traction loss without the need of additional actuator in . With the capability to generate up to 1000 positions per second, it is only limited by the specs of the actuators in terms of accelerations, speed and load.

Over the past decade, manufacturers of motion simulators have been focused on the FORCES and on force delivery. The forces involved in driving a car are important but NOT essential for PRO racing training. Almost all simulator of this kind today act like a pinball machine … and almost all PRO race car drivers ask to stop the motion simulator when they give this a try… this is perfectly normal, all the movements are over-reactive and exaggerated, they feel the forces but not the car and the road surface.

The force factor must be balanced with ultra-realistic movements to give the internal auditory system enough information to properly sense the car’s chassis and the road surface. This balance is the key feature to the internal V.P.I. system of MotionMax Manager (Vehicle Physics Interpreter) and even if we also provide a 2DOF+TL management software this is ONLY possible on a real 6DOF car racing motion platform, The Yaw Dynamic System completes the V.P.I to manage the traction control without additional DOF machinery (another unique feature of MotionMax Manager 6DOF). All other machines will NEVER give you a complete information from the car racing simulation. If you still want a more conventional simulator for your non PRO configuration and DIY projects you may consider the MotionMax 2DOF+TL manager.

PRO drivers love our motion system, the feeling is natural, the motion signal pure and clear and the feedback is complete and accurate. They do not need more than a lap to feel at home and have a perfect control!

# How To Get MotionMax 2DOF/6DOF?
MotionMax Manager SCN Edition 2DOF+TL is available from EKSIMRacing foundation (read the getting started information below if you’re interested), the MotionMax 6DOF is available for purchase to general public with the motion simulator platform from HERE. Also, the software is included with simulators manufactured by private motorsports companies, OEM hardware motion simulator companies and actuator manufacturers who are in partnership with us.

# Simulation And Game Studios:
Contact us for adding the support of your game/simulation to MotionMax Manager.

Electric Linear Actuators And Motion Platform Manufacturers:
Contact us if you’re a manufacturer and want us to add the support of your electric linear actuator to MotionMax Manager. We’re always happy to add the support of new electric linear actuator to our motion software.

# Authorized Dealers:
We are looking for distributors of our MotionMax software to promote 2DOF and 6DOF motion simulator platform (firstly) based on Dyadic SCN electric linear actuator. EKSIMRacing foundation is a nonprofit organization, our vocation is not to sell products directly but to promote sim-racing worldwide as we did during the past decade with racing display usb device and virtual racing dash display (Emulators). Contact us If you have a strong experience with SCN actuators and want to bundle your products with one of the best racing simulator management software. Make sure to send as much information as possible about your company, your position, your simulator project, your hardware,… to get a quick answer. To contact us use this form.
